Project 1b - Prototype

Project Name: CheckIn4Me

Project Description: 
CheckIn4Me will be a Android mobile application.  Its purpose is to provide an all-in-one app 
for "checking in" with location-based services (ie: Foursquare, Gowalla, BrightKite, etc). 
CheckIn4Me will use APIs provided by those location based services to generate a normalized
list of nearby locations known by the services.  The user will then be able to choose a location,
choose the services desired, and check-in to that location (thus, allowing a user to check-in
to the same location on multiple services via one app).

Files Included:
- CheckIn4MeFlow.pdf - Main pdf for seeing the flow of the application between screens.
- CheckIn4MeAll.pdf - All of the individual GUI screens making up the flow diagram and the flow 
  diagram itself.
- pngs directory - all of the screens and the flow diagram as png files (in case they are useful
  to somebody).

Goals:
- In order to concentrate more on the User Interface and Interaction, the goal for this
  project is to only get at least two location-services working with the app.  This is
  because of the possible problems that could be encountered in the back-end programming,
  which is not really in the scope of the course (issues could range from OAuth problems
  to general API problems, since these have nothing to do with the GUI, the goal is to 
  avoid wasting much time on them).
- If there is enough time at the end, another goal would be to add either a) more services, or
  b) more interface interaction, such as writing comments with check-ins, searching for places,
  or viewing friend/profile information by service. This is a project that I wish to continue
  with in the future (outside of class) so the true goal is to get as working as possible. The 
  more realistic goal, given the short time frame, is the first goal mentioned above.

Misc:
Interaction not shown in the "typical_flow.pdf" file:
- The back button on the phone will go back to the previous screen (as is to be expected).
- The home button will return the user to the main Android home screen.
- Any other buttons on a particular phone will do nothing or their default behavior. 
Screens not included as PDF's:
- Any error messages will be displayed in the same manner as the "Check-In Success" screen,
  however, an error message will be displayed instead.  Clicking "Ok" on an error message
  will return the user to the page they encountered the error on.
Creating the Prototype:
- The original prototype was drawn on a whiteboard, but taking photos of it didn't turn out
  very well.
- These prototypes are recreations of the whiteboard prototypes using Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop.
- Logos and icons were borrowed from the services' websites.
